Hey there, I'm Marc, I'm a software engineer, serial hobby collector and technologist from Northern Ireland.

This website features my musings, speculation and rambling on technology, my projects and how our industry works. 

Currently I work in the [Innovation Team](https://medium.com/kainos-applied-innovation) at [Kainos](https://kainos.com).
