Hey there, I'm Marc, I'm a software engineer, serial hobby collector and technologist from Northern Ireland.

This website features my musings, speculation and rambling on technology, my projects and how our industry works. 

Currently I work in the [Innovation Team](https://medium.com/kainos-applied-innovation) At [Kainos](https//kainos.com).

Want to get in touch? You can find me around the web in the links in the footer!
